I gave a talk!  This time at the
[Sydney Rust meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sydney/), covering
the state-of-the-union of Rust packaging in Debian, and some of the
outstanding issues/directions.  I think some people were surprised at
the amount of work beyond `./configure install --prefix=/usr && make
install`.
